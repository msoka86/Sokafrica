# Sokafrica

Vision Statement :

I’m working with anyone from the African social entrepreneurship scene to map the social entrepreneurship sector in the continent for enhanced visibility and fostering of crosscountry collaboration and exchange of know-how.

The Problem :

There is a lack of centralised information about social entrepreneurship across Africa, resulting in a lack of visibility that hinders the development of the sector. Be it a student interested in setting up her/his social business or an impact investor looking to diversify her/his portfolio, both will not find answers to their questions by only browsing the internet.

The Solution :

I wish to develop a solution based platform to document startup stories on entrepreneurship and access to resources that could lead to the creation of interactive forum/platform allowing african entrepreneurs to create synergies. The platform can be used by anyone interested in social entrepreneurship in Africa, but will primarily be tailored for established social entrepreneurs in the continent as well as the main stakeholders of the sector (investors and financial institutions, foundations, development institutions, incubators and accelerators, researchers). It will be a mapping of Africa social entrepreneurship scene, its stories of victories and others of loss, recounted by Africans for Africans. 


## Getting Started

The approach is to develop a database based on a custom framework through a website, this online portal will allow users to log in and share their information and by doing that make sure they are in control of their narrative. However, at a later stage interviews with registered startups will be undertaken in order to gather more stories and information.

At the moment we will be giving priority to Social Businesses which in spite of their impact on the community do not receive enough media coverage (for lack of digital tools, lack of language skills or belonging to an under-represented community).

## Who We Are?

I’m the founder and project lead of Sokafrica, a graduate in finance and communication. I am also an analyst, a writer, a dreamer, an occasional number cruncher, a social entrepreneurship enthusiast and a proud daughter of the black continent.

I've been passionate about building open communities especially in marginalized societies to bridge digital divides, and social entrepreneurship is a subject I feel strongly about, as it boosts economy and helps fight economic and social inqualities. So combining the two seemed liked an obvious path to take for me. This is the main drive and inspiration to this project.

I look forward to engaging and establishing long term partnerships with local and global organizations who share the same passion to better provide visibility, openness and collaboration to the Social entrepreneurship scene in Africa.

What I Need :

First, any contribution is a welcome contribution, just drop me a message.

Second and last, our priority resides with web development and web design, as well as content contributors.
